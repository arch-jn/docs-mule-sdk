== Add a Custom Icon to Your Connector

Connector icons are files in the .svg format. To customize the icon of a connector, add an `icon.svg` file that contains the custom icon under the `icon` folder in the root of the connector tree.

The following image shows an example of the folder structure for the icon:

After you add the custom icon to your connector, the icon appears in Anypoint Exchange and in Anypoint Studio.
