Specify the Java compatibility of your custom module. In Mule 4.6.0 and later, custom modules that do not specify the Java compatibility are assumed to be compatible with Java 8 and Java 11 only. If your custom module is compatible with a more recent Java version, you must specify the Java compatibility to include that version.
