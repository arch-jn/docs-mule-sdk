Testing ensures that a piece of code works correctly. To properly test your module, you need to ensure two types of unit testing: one that tests your module's internal business logic, and another one that tests the interaction between your module and the runtime to ensure compatibility with the Mule ecosystem.

The Module Testing Framework (Beta) leverages MUnit to provide this Mule ecosystem.

Test cases that test internal business logic run during the `test` phase of your module's lifecycle. MUnit tests goal is to test the interaction of your module with the Mule environment. These tests run during the `integration-test` phase of your module's lifecycle.

Below are a series of articles that explain in detail how to test your module. These articles provide a step-by-step introduction on how to test a module and explain the basics of the Module Testing Framework (Beta)
and how to execute a simple operation from a Module:
