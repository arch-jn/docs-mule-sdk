== Define a Multipart Request

Multipart content definition in both RAML 1.0 and OAS2 lacks some
features, such as the ability to define the content type of each part of
a multipart body. The connector descriptor can amend these issues.

In the following example, the API spec defines a multipart request:

[source,yaml]
----
/attachment:
 post:
   body:
     multipart/form-data:
       properties:
         requestid:
           type: string
         attributes:
           type: attribute[]
         attachment:
           type: file
   responses:
     200:
       description: Successful call
----

The following example shows several improvements to the multipart
request by adding extra information to the body parts of the POST
attachment endpoint:

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
 /attachment:
   operations:
     post:
       expects:
         part:
           requestid:
             displayName: "Request-ID"
             description: The tracking ID for this request
           attributes:
             contentType: application/json
             description: A list of attributes for this attachment
           attachment:
             contentType: text/csv
             file: true
----

== Set a Display Name for a Part

Parameters in the request body can supply an alternative name using the
`displayName` property. In the example above, the final connector UI
shows `requestid` as `Request-ID`.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
 /attachment:
   operations:
     post:
       expects:
         part:
           requestid:
             displayName: "Request-ID"
----

== Set a Description for a Part

The previous example assigned descriptions to 2 of the parts defined in
the body. This appears to the users as a contextual tooltip when working
with this operation.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
 /attachment:
   operations:
     post:
       expects:
         part:
           requestid:
             description: The tracking ID for this request
           attributes:
             description: A list of attributes for this attachment
----

== Define File Parts

You must use the `file` property to state that a body part represents a
file. This creates an implicit parameter with the filename that the user
must fill to use the generated operation.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
 /attachment:
   operations:
     post:
       expects:
         part:
           attachment:
             file: true
----

== Define the Content Type of a Part

Each part of a multipart request can define its own content type that is
sent in the content disposition header of that part when the HTTP
request is done.

You define the value that the header should have in the request by using
the `contentType` property. This also helps the user of the connector know
what content type is expected for that part.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
 /attachment:
   operations:
     post:
       expects:
         part:
           attributes:
             contentType: application/json
           attachment:
             contentType: text/csv
             file: true
----

In this example, the attributes object must be sent as an
`application/json` object and that the expected file type is a .txt or
.csv.

== Redefine the Expected Content for a Part

If the API spec does not specify the expected structure of a part (or
defines it in an incorrect way), you can redefine it using a JSON
schema.

You must use the `inputType` property. The value for this property must be
the path to the JsonSchema relative to the location of the Connector
Descriptor file.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
 /attachment:
   operations:
     post:
       expects:
         part:
           attributes:
             description: A list of attributes for this attachment
             inputType: './ip-attributes.json'
----

The structure of the attributes part of the request is structured to be
like the following JSON schema:

[source,json]
----
{
 "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
 "$ref": "#/definitions/IPAttributes",
 "definitions": {
   "IPAttributes": {
   "type": "object",
   "properties": {
     "local": {"type": "boolean"},
     "broadcast": {"type": "boolean"},
     "type": {"type": "string"}
   }
 }}
}
----
