== Operation Identifiers

REST SDK relies on an operation identifier to generate classes for resources.

REST SDK provides a default mechanism to generate an operation
identifier if there is a valid `operationId` from an OAS context with a non
null value. It also executes a fallback if there is an HTTP method and unique
resource name, and executes only if `operationId` is null. The identifier cannot
collide with resources, triggers, or other REST
SDK components.

REST SDK provides a default mechanism to generate an operation
identifier if there is a valid `operationId` from an OAS context with a non
null value. Customize the default mechanism by modifying the descriptor. Input your own
custom DataWeave script to change how the operation identifiers are generated.

Use these three bindings to modify the mechanism:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Binding name|Type|Description
|`operationId` | `String` \| `null` | Identifier of the operation. Can be null.
|`method` | `String` | HTTP method. Not nullable.
|`path` | `String` | HTTP full path. Not nullable.
|===

Add a root `operationIdentifier` key to the descriptor file with the
DataWeave script. The following example shows a default DataWeave
script that REST SDK is currently using:

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connector Descriptor 1.0
...
operationIdentifier:
  expression: |
    #[%dw 2.0
    output text/plain
    ---
    operationId default (method ++ path)
    ]
----

This identifier is important not only in the Java class generation but also
in the DSL and display name of a given operation, which means there are cases
where you must change the default DataWeave script for `operationIdentifier`
as well.

Imagine there is an API that contains dates and extensions in the resources, which is
not useful to the user of the connector, and does not contain an
`operationId` because it is either empty in the OAS spec or because it is an RAML
spec. For example, in `/2010-04-01/Accounts/{id}/Messages/SMS/Media.json`,
both `/2010-04-01/` and `.json` are not useful to the user. The following example
shows a DataWeave script that eliminates these parts:

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connector Descriptor 1.0
....
operationIdentifier:
  expression: |
    #[%dw 2.0
    output text/plain
    fun removeUnwantedStuff(aPath: String)=
        aPath replace ".json" with ""
          replace "/2010-04-01" with ""
    ---
    method ++ removeUnwantedStuff(path)
    ]
----

The operation identifier for the operation that maps to the resource `/2010-04-01/Accounts/{id}/Messages/SMS/Media.json` is now
`/Accounts/{id}/Messages/SMS/Media`, which significantly improves the naming
around the resource for the XML DSL as well as the UI experience.

== Set a Display Name for an Operation

You can define the display name of an operation by using the `displayName`
property in the operation node.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
   /content_search:
      operations:
         get:
            pagination: content-search-pagination
            displayName: Get Content Search
            description: Provides keyword and refinement search functionality for content assets.
            outputMediaType: application/json
            expects:
               queryParameter:
                  count:
                     displayName: count
                     description: The maximum number of instances per request.
----

By setting this property, the operation is available to the final user
with the display name in the UI:

image::operation-display-name.png[]

Imagine there is an API that needs the display name changed by
comprehension rather than extension. REST SDK provides a DataWeave script to
delegate to, which is useful when there is a common pattern that needs to be
removed from all display names.

REST SDK provides a default script for display names that relies
on `operationId` if it is not null, or `method` and `path` together.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connector Descriptor 1.0
....
operationDisplayName:
  expression: |
        #[%dw 2.0
          output text/plain
          import * from connectivity::RestSdk
          ---
          displayNameFromOperationId(operationId)
            default displayNameFromMethodAndPath(method, path)
        ]
----

For more information about those two DataWeave functions, refer to https://github.com/mulesoft/rest-sdk-all/blob/master/rest-sdk-connector-model/src/main/resources/connectivity/RestSdk.dwl[RestSdk.dwl].

Customize the default mechanism by modifying the descriptor. Input your own
custom DataWeave script to change how the display names are generated.

Use these four bindings to modify the mechanism:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Binding name|Type|Description
|`operationId` | `String` \| `null` | Identifier of the operation. Can be null.
|`method` | `String` | HTTP method. Not nullable.
|`path` | `String` | HTTP full path. Not nullable.
|`summary` | `String` \| `null` | Summary of the operation that matches the summary in OAS. Can be null.
|===

Imagine there is an API that contains dates and extensions in the resources, which is
not useful to the user of the connector, and does not contain an
`operationId` because it is either empty in the OAS spec or because it is an RAML
spec. For example, in `/2010-04-01/Accounts/Messages/SMS/Media.json`,
both `/2010-04-01/` and `.json` are not useful to the user. The following example
shows a DataWeave script that eliminates these parts:

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connector Descriptor 1.0
...
operationDisplayName:
  expression: |
    #[%dw 2.0
    output text/plain
    import * from dw::core::Strings
    fun removeUnwantedStuff(aPath: String)=
      aPath replace ".json" with ""
        replace "/2010-04-01" with ""
          replace "/" with " "
    ---
    capitalize(method) ++ removeUnwantedStuff(path)
    ]
----

Note that it is not necessary to use `operationId` since it is null for this scenario.
For the `/2010-04-01/Accounts/Messages/SMS/Media.json` endpoint, the generated
display name is `Post Accounts Messages SMS Media`, assuming the `method` is POST.

The DataWeave script library contains other helper functions as well. Refer to https://github.com/mulesoft/rest-sdk-all/blob/master/rest-sdk-connector-model/src/main/resources/connectivity/RestSdk.dwl[RestSdk.dwl].
The following example shows another DataWeave script you can import to eliminate some parts:

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connector Descriptor 1.0
...
operationDisplayName:
  expression: |
    #[%dw 2.0
    output text/plain
    import * from connectivity::RestSdk
    fun removeUnwantedStuff(aPath: String)=
      aPath replace ".json" with ""
        replace "/2010-04-01" with ""
    ---
    displayNameFromMethodAndPath(method, removeTwilioStuff(path))
    ]
----

For the `/2010-04-01/Accounts/Messages/SMS/Media.json` endpoint, the generated
display name is `Create Accounts Messages SMS Media`, assuming the `method` is POST.

== Set a Description for an Operation

You can define the description of an operation by using the
`description` property in the operation node.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
   /content_search:
      operations:
         get:
            pagination: content-search-pagination
            displayName: Get Content Search
            description: Provides keyword and refinement search functionality for content assets.
            outputMediaType: application/json
            expects:
               queryParameter:
                  count:
                     displayName: count
                     description: The maximum number of instances per request.
----

The `description` property can be used to give the final user of the
connector some context or explanation of what the operation does. It
appears in Anypoint Studio as a tooltip.

image::operation-description-tooltip.png[]

[[select-default-media-type-for-an-operation]]
== Select a Default Media Type for an Operation

Both RAML and OAS API specs allow you to define multiple media types for
the operations.

REST SDK uses only one media type to generate the operation.

If it is not defined using a custom property, the default one is
selected following this priority:

* _application/json_ if it is defined
* _application/xml_ if it is defined
* The first media type defined in the API spec for that body

If you want to select the operation media type manually, you can use the
`inputMediaType` and `outputMediaType` properties. These properties
allow you to define the request body media type and the response media
type respectively.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
   /content_search:
      operations:
         get:
            pagination: content-search-pagination
            displayName: Get Content Search
            description: Provides keyword and refinement search functionality for content assets.
            inputMediaType: application/json
            outputMediaType: application/json
            expects:
               queryParameter:
                  count:
                     displayName: count
                     description: The maximum number of instances per request.
----

== Select a Default Media Type for All Operations

If you want to select a default media type for your operations like
defined in xref:rest-sdk/configure-operations.adoc#select-default-media-type-for-an-operation[Select a Default Media Type for an Operation] but you want
to do it globally, you can use the `defaultInputMediaType` and
`defaultOutputMediaType` properties at the root level of the Connector
Descriptor.

[source,yaml]
----
defaultInputMediaType: application/json
defaultOutputMediaType: application/json

endpoints:
   /content_search:
      operations:
         get:
            pagination: content-search-pagination
            displayName: Get Content Search
            description: Provides keyword and refinement search functionality for content assets.
            expects:
               queryParameter:
                  count:
                     displayName: count
                     description: The maximum number of instances per request.
----

== Ignore an Operation

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
   /flights/{ID}:
      operations:
         delete:
            ignored: true
----

In this case, only the DELETE verb is ignored. Operations are still
generated for the other verbs in the resource.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
   /flights/{ID}:
      ignored: true
----

In this case, all of the endpoint verbs will be ignored. No operations
will be generated for this resource.

== Ignore an Operation or Endpoint

If you don’t want to generate an operation in the connector for a
resource that is present in the API spec, you must use the `ignored`
property. You can define the ignored property at endpoint or operation
level.

If you ignore an endpoint, none of the operations defined under the
endpoint are generated.

If you ignore an operation, only that operation is not generated; the
rest of the operations for that endpoint are generated.

== Ignore Operations and Triggers by Default

All operations and triggers can be ignored using the `ignoreOperations` property at the root of the descriptor.

Set `ignoreOperations` to `true` to ignore previously declared operations and triggers. You can use this property to select only a small subset of operations and triggers for the connector to generate.

If an operation or trigger is ignored in a previous layer but `ignoreOperations` is set to `false`,
the operation or trigger will be generated in the connector.

If an operation or trigger is not ignored in a previous layer but `ignoreOperations` is set to `true`,
the operation or trigger will not be generated in the connector.

Using this property is similar to adding an `ignored` property to all of the operations and triggers.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connector Descriptor 1.0

ignoreOperations: true

endpoints:
   /flights/{ID}:
      ignored: false
----

In this example, only the operations under the `/flights/{ID}` path will be generated. All of the other operations and triggers will be ignored.

== Hide an Operation

This pattern is used to hide operations. Operations declared in the connector's first (base) layer can be hidden by ignoring them in a subsequent descriptor layer to generate a connector with a subset of operations.

The following example shows the descriptor's base layer:

----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

apiSpec:
 url: http://myhost.com/resources/slack-api.yaml

connectorName: Slack Connector

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: slack-connector
 version: 1.0.0
----

This will generate all the operations of the connector that are declared in the source API specification.

To generate a connector with only a subset of the operations from the API specification while also maintaining all the customizations declared in the descriptor's base layer, you can use a new descriptor layer to hide some operations:

----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: composed-slack-connector
 version: 1.0.0

endpoints:
    /users:
        ignored: true
----

All the operations under the `/users` endpoint are ignored and will not be present
in the generated connector.

By using this metadata, you can select which operation is and is not available
to the user when you choose an event in Composer.

== Rename an Operation

This pattern is used to customize operation names.

The following example shows the descriptor's base layer:

----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

apiSpec:
 url: http://myhost.com/resources/slack-api.yaml

connectorName: Slack Connector

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: slack-connector
 version: 1.0.0

endpoints:
    /users:
        operations:
            get:
                displayName: Get users by email
----

The operation is currently named `Get users by email`.

You can rename an operation in the `/users` section of the descriptor:

----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: composed-slack-connector
 version: 1.0.0

endpoints:
    /users:
        operations:
            get:
                displayName: Get all users by email
----

In the generated connector, the operation is now renamed `Get all users by email`.

By using this metadata, you can rename an operation for the user when you
choose an event in Composer.

== Redefine an Operation Input or Output Type

The API spec may not define an input/output type; if you need one, you
can use the `inputType` and `outputType` properties in the Connector
Descriptor. You can set these properties at the operation level in the
connector descriptor. +
 +
For example, let’s say we have the following OAS spec.

[source,json5]
----
{
"paths": {
 "/payment_instrument/{payment_instrument_id}": {
   "post": {
     "responses": {
       "default": {
         "description": ""
       }
     }
   }
//[..]
}
----

In this case, the operation does not define input or output metadata. +
You can add it using the following descriptor:

[source,yaml]
----
defaultInputMediaType: application/json
defaultOutputMediaType: application/json

endpoints:
 /payment_instrument/{payment_instrument_id}:
   operations:
     post:
       inputType: './payment-instrument.json'
       outputType: './payment-instrument.json'
----

The operation uses the type definition from that schema as input and
output metadata. +
The value of this property must be the path to a JSON schema relative to
the location of the connector descriptor file. +
 +
In this case, the JSON schema appears as follows:

[source,json]
----
{
 "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
 "$ref": "#/definitions/PaymentInstrument",
 "definitions": {
   "PaymentInstrument": {
   "type": "object",
   "properties": {
     "name": {"type": "string"}
   },
   "required": [
     "name"
   ]
 }}
}
----

== Override an Operation Input or Output Type

You can also use the inputType and outputType properties to override the
type that is defined in the API spec. If a type is defined in the
connector descriptor, the one in the API spec is ignored.

== Skip Output Type Validations

`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `OPTIONS` operations defined in the API spec must declare a response body and a type for that body. If they do not, the connector descriptor must skip this check, define a response body for the operation, or declare it as void. +
+
Though is not the recommended approach, you can skip the this check using the `skipOutputTypeValidation` property in the connector descriptor.

It can be used at the operation level or globally.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connector Descriptor 1.0
apiSpec:
  url: './api.raml'
connectorName: Version Manager
skipOutputTypeValidation: true           #<-- Global
endpoints:
  /endpoints/users:
    operations:
      get:
        skipOutputTypeValidation: true   #<-- Operation Level
----

If the validation is skipped, the generated connector still generates an `InputStream` output for the operation, and it contains the actual server response, but without informing the user that this operation has an output. This is not recommended and should be avoided as much as possible.

If the operation does not have an output, the `voidOperation` property should be used instead of this.

== Void Operations

`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `OPTIONS` operations defined in the API spec must declare a response body and a type for that body. If they don't, the connector descriptor must skip this check, define a response body for the operation, or declare it as void.

You can declare the operation as void using the `voidOperation` property of the operation node in the connector descriptor:

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connector Descriptor 1.0
apiSpec:
 url: './api.raml'
connectorName: Version Manager
endpoints:
 /endpoints/void:
   operations:
     get:
       voidOperation: true   #<-- Operation Level
----

Using this property causes the operation to not have an `InputStream` as output. Instead, it always returns an empty string output. Using this property also causes the actual server response to be discarded. The HTTP response properties are still returned as attributes.
