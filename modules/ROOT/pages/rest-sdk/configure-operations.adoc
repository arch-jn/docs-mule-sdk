= Customize the Connector's Operations
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::../_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

Customize an existing operation of the connector descriptor of the connector.

== Set an Operation Identifier for an Operation

To set an operation identifier for an operation, you must use the REST SDK
default provided mechanism.

REST SDK relies on an operation identifier to generate classes for resources.
Use the REST SDK mechanism to generate an operation identifier when:

* using a valid `operationId` with a non null value from an OAS context
* using an HTTP `method` and an HTTP full `path` with an `operationId` with a null value to execute a fallback

The operation identifier cannot collide with resources, triggers, or other
REST SDK components.

Use these three bindings to modify the mechanism:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Binding name|Type|Description
|`operationId` | `String` \| `null` | Identifier of the operation. Can be null.
|`method` | `String` | HTTP method. Not nullable.
|`path` | `String` | HTTP full path. Not nullable.
|===

== Set a Display Name for an Operation

To set a display name for an operation, you must set the `displayName` property,
which is located in the operation node.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
   /content_search:
      operations:
         get:
            pagination: content-search-pagination
            displayName: Get Content Search
            description: Provides keyword and refinement search functionality for content assets.
            outputMediaType: application/json
            expects:
               queryParameter:
                  count:
                     displayName: count
                     description: The maximum number of instances per request.
----

The name you set for the operation is available to the user with the display
name in the UI.

== Change a Generated Display Name for an Operation

To change a generated display name for an operation, you must use either the
REST SDK default DataWeave script or a custom DataWeave script.

* <<default>>
** <<default-op-id>>
** <<default-method-and-path>>

* <<custom>>
** <<custom-op-id>>
** <<custom-method-and-path>>

[[default]]
=== Change a Generated Display Name for an Operation Using the REST SDK Default DataWeave Script

REST SDK provides a default DataWeave script to delegate to, which is useful when
there is a common pattern that needs to be changed in all operation display names by
comprehension rather than extension.

The default DataWeave script relies on either an `operationId` with a non null value
or both an HTTP `method` and an HTTP full `path` with an `operationId` with a null value.

[[default-op-id]]
==== Change a Generated Display Name for an Operation Using the REST SDK Default DataWeave Script with an Operation ID

The following example shows a default DataWeave script that relies on an
`operationId` with a non null value:

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connector Descriptor 1.0
...
operationIdentifier:
  expression: |
    #[%dw 2.0
    output text/plain
    ---
    operationId default (method ++ path)
    ]
----

For more information about the functions in the default DataWeave script, refer to
https://github.com/mulesoft/rest-sdk-all/blob/master/rest-sdk-connector-model/src/main/resources/connectivity/RestSdk.dwl[RestSdk.dwl].

[[default-method-and-path]]
==== Change a Generated Display Name for an Operation Using the REST SDK Default DataWeave Script with an HTTP Method and an HTTP Full Path

The following example shows a default DataWeave script that relies on both an HTTP
`method` and an HTTP full `path` with an `operationId` with a null value:

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connector Descriptor 1.0
....
operationDisplayName:
  expression: |
        #[%dw 2.0
          output text/plain
          import * from connectivity::RestSdk
          ---
          displayNameFromOperationId(operationId)
            default displayNameFromMethodAndPath(method, path)
        ]
----

For more information about the functions in the default DataWeave script, refer to
https://github.com/mulesoft/rest-sdk-all/blob/master/rest-sdk-connector-model/src/main/resources/connectivity/RestSdk.dwl[RestSdk.dwl].

[[custom]]
=== Change a Generated Display Name for an Operation Using a Custom DataWeave Script

You can also customize the default DataWeave script by modifying the descriptor. Input your own
custom DataWeave script to change how the display names get generated.

Use these four bindings to modify the script:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Binding name|Type|Description
|`operationId` | `String` \| `null` | Identifier of the operation. Can be null.
|`method` | `String` | HTTP method. Not nullable.
|`path` | `String` | HTTP full path. Not nullable.
|`summary` | `String` \| `null` | Summary of the operation that matches the summary in OAS. Can be null.
|===

The custom DataWeave script relies on either an `operationId` with a non null value
or both an HTTP `method` and an HTTP full `path` with an `operationId` with a null value.

[[custom-op-id]]
==== Change a Generated Display Name for an Operation Using a Custom DataWeave Script Using an Operation ID

If you are using an `operationId` in your custom DataWeave script, you must change
the DataWeave script for `operationIdentifier` as well.

For example, suppose there is an API that contains dates and extensions in the
resources, which is not useful to the user of the connector. For example, in the
resource `/2010-04-01/Accounts/{id}/Messages/SMS/Media.json`, both `/2010-04-01/` and
`.json` are not useful to the user and those parts do not need to be
generated for the operation display names.

The following example shows a custom DataWeave script that relies on an `operationIdentifier`
that eliminates these parts from the operation display names:

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connector Descriptor 1.0
....
operationIdentifier:
  expression: |
    #[%dw 2.0
    output text/plain
    fun removeUnwantedStuff(aPath: String)=
        aPath replace ".json" with ""
          replace "/2010-04-01" with ""
    ---
    method ++ removeUnwantedStuff(path)
    ]
----

The operation identifier for the operation that maps to the resource `/2010-04-01/Accounts/{id}/Messages/SMS/Media.json` is now
`/Accounts/{id}/Messages/SMS/Media`, which significantly improves the naming
around the resource for the XML DSL as well as the UI experience.

[[custom-method-and-path]]
==== Change a Generated Display Name for an Operation Using a Custom DataWeave Script Using an HTTP Method and an HTTP Full Path

For example, suppose there is an API that contains dates and extensions in the
resources, which is not useful to the user of the connector, and does not contain an
`operationId` because it is either empty in the OAS specification or because it is an RAML
specification. For example, in the resource `/2010-04-01/Accounts/Messages/SMS/Media.json`,
both `/2010-04-01/` and `.json` are not useful to the user and those parts do not need to be
generated for the operation display names.

The following example shows a custom DataWeave script that relies on an HTTP `method` and an HTTP
full `path` with an `operationId` with a null value that eliminates these parts from
the operation display names:

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connector Descriptor 1.0
...
operationDisplayName:
  expression: |
    #[%dw 2.0
    output text/plain
    import * from dw::core::Strings
    fun removeUnwantedStuff(aPath: String)=
      aPath replace ".json" with ""
        replace "/2010-04-01" with ""
          replace "/" with " "
    ---
    capitalize(method) ++ removeUnwantedStuff(path)
    ]
----

It is not necessary to use an `operationId` since it is null for this scenario.
For the `/2010-04-01/Accounts/Messages/SMS/Media.json` endpoint, the generated
display name is now `Post Accounts Messages SMS Media`, assuming the `method` is POST.

The DataWeave script library contains other helper functions as well. For more
information about helper functions to use in the custom DataWeave script, refer
to https://github.com/mulesoft/rest-sdk-all/blob/master/rest-sdk-connector-model/src/main/resources/connectivity/RestSdk.dwl[RestSdk.dwl].

The following example shows another custom DataWeave script that relies on an HTTP `method` and an HTTP
full `path` with an `operationId` with a null value that eliminates specific parts from the
operation display names:

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connector Descriptor 1.0
...
operationDisplayName:
  expression: |
    #[%dw 2.0
    output text/plain
    import * from connectivity::RestSdk
    fun removeUnwantedStuff(aPath: String)=
      aPath replace ".json" with ""
        replace "/2010-04-01" with ""
    ---
    displayNameFromMethodAndPath(method, removeTwilioStuff(path))
    ]
----

For the `/2010-04-01/Accounts/Messages/SMS/Media.json` endpoint, the generated
display name is now `Create Accounts Messages SMS Media`, assuming the `method` is POST.

== Set a Description for an Operation

To set a description for an operation, you must set the `description` property,
which is located in the operation node.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
   /content_search:
      operations:
         get:
            pagination: content-search-pagination
            displayName: Get Content Search
            description: Provides keyword and refinement search functionality for content assets.
            outputMediaType: application/json
            expects:
               queryParameter:
                  count:
                     displayName: count
                     description: The maximum number of instances per request.
----

Set the `description` property to give the user some context or an explanation
of what the operation does. The description you set for the operation appears
in Anypoint Studio as a tooltip.

image::operation-description-tooltip.png[]

[[select-default-media-type-for-an-operation]]
== Select a Default Media Type for an Operation

To select a default media type for an operation, you must use the `inputMediaType`
and `outputMediaType` properties, which are located in the operation node.

Both RAML and OAS API specifications enable you to define multiple media types for
operations. REST SDK uses only one media type to generate an operation.

To select a default media type for an operation manually, use the `inputMediaType`
and `outputMediaType` properties to define the request body media type and the
response media type respectively.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
   /content_search:
      operations:
         get:
            pagination: content-search-pagination
            displayName: Get Content Search
            description: Provides keyword and refinement search functionality for content assets.
            inputMediaType: application/json
            outputMediaType: application/json
            expects:
               queryParameter:
                  count:
                     displayName: count
                     description: The maximum number of instances per request.
----

If a default media type for an operation is not defined using a custom property,
the default media type is selected following this priority:

* _application/json_ if it is defined
* _application/xml_ if it is defined
* The first media type defined in the API specification for that body

== Select a Default Media Type for All Operations

To select a default media type for all operations, similar to how a default media type is
defined in xref:rest-sdk/configure-operations.adoc#select-default-media-type-for-an-operation[Select a Default Media Type for an Operation], but you want
to do it globally, you must use the `defaultInputMediaType` and `defaultOutputMediaType`
properties, which are located at the root of the connector descriptor.

[source,yaml]
----
defaultInputMediaType: application/json
defaultOutputMediaType: application/json

endpoints:
   /content_search:
      operations:
         get:
            pagination: content-search-pagination
            displayName: Get Content Search
            description: Provides keyword and refinement search functionality for content assets.
            expects:
               queryParameter:
                  count:
                     displayName: count
                     description: The maximum number of instances per request.
----

== Ignore an Operation or an Endpoint

To ignore an operation or an endpoint, you must use the `ignored` property,
which can be defined at either the operation level or the endpoint level.

Use the `ignored` property when you do not want to generate an operation in the
connector for a resource that is present in the API specification.

If you define the `ignored` property at the operation level, only that operation
is not generated while the rest of the operations for that endpoint are generated.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
   /flights/{ID}:
      operations:
         delete:
            ignored: true
----

In this case, only the DELETE verb is ignored. Operations are still
generated for the other verbs in the resource.

If you define the `ignored` property at the endpoint level, none of the operations
defined under the endpoint are generated.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
   /flights/{ID}:
      ignored: true
----

In this case, all of the endpoint verbs are ignored. No operations
are generated for this resource.

== Ignore Operations and Triggers by Default

All operations and triggers can be ignored using the `ignoreOperations` property at the root of the descriptor.

Set `ignoreOperations` to `true` to ignore previously declared operations and triggers. You can use this property to select only a small subset of operations and triggers for the connector to generate.

If an operation or trigger is ignored in a previous layer but `ignoreOperations` is set to `false`,
the operation or trigger will be generated in the connector.

If an operation or trigger is not ignored in a previous layer but `ignoreOperations` is set to `true`,
the operation or trigger will not be generated in the connector.

Using this property is similar to adding an `ignored` property to all of the operations and triggers.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connector Descriptor 1.0

ignoreOperations: true

endpoints:
   /flights/{ID}:
      ignored: false
----

In this example, only the operations under the `/flights/{ID}` path will be generated. All of the other operations and triggers will be ignored.

== Hide an Operation

This pattern is used to hide operations. Operations declared in the connector's first (base) layer can be hidden by ignoring them in a subsequent descriptor layer to generate a connector with a subset of operations.

The following example shows the descriptor's base layer:

----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

apiSpec:
 url: http://myhost.com/resources/slack-api.yaml

connectorName: Slack Connector

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: slack-connector
 version: 1.0.0
----

This will generate all the operations of the connector that are declared in the source API specification.

To generate a connector with only a subset of the operations from the API specification while also maintaining all the customizations declared in the descriptor's base layer, you can use a new descriptor layer to hide some operations:

----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: composed-slack-connector
 version: 1.0.0

endpoints:
    /users:
        ignored: true
----

All the operations under the `/users` endpoint are ignored and will not be present
in the generated connector.

By using this metadata, you can select which operation is and is not available
to the user when you choose an event in Composer.

== Rename an Operation

This pattern is used to customize operation names.

The following example shows the descriptor's base layer:

----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

apiSpec:
 url: http://myhost.com/resources/slack-api.yaml

connectorName: Slack Connector

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: slack-connector
 version: 1.0.0

endpoints:
    /users:
        operations:
            get:
                displayName: Get users by email
----

The operation is currently named `Get users by email`.

You can rename an operation in the `/users` section of the descriptor:

----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: composed-slack-connector
 version: 1.0.0

endpoints:
    /users:
        operations:
            get:
                displayName: Get all users by email
----

In the generated connector, the operation is now renamed `Get all users by email`.

By using this metadata, you can rename an operation for the user when you
choose an event in Composer.

== Redefine an Operation Input or Output Type

The API spec may not define an input/output type; if you need one, you
can use the `inputType` and `outputType` properties in the Connector
Descriptor. You can set these properties at the operation level in the
connector descriptor. +
 +
For example, let’s say we have the following OAS spec.

[source,json5]
----
{
"paths": {
 "/payment_instrument/{payment_instrument_id}": {
   "post": {
     "responses": {
       "default": {
         "description": ""
       }
     }
   }
//[..]
}
----

In this case, the operation does not define input or output metadata. +
You can add it using the following descriptor:

[source,yaml]
----
defaultInputMediaType: application/json
defaultOutputMediaType: application/json

endpoints:
 /payment_instrument/{payment_instrument_id}:
   operations:
     post:
       inputType: './payment-instrument.json'
       outputType: './payment-instrument.json'
----

The operation uses the type definition from that schema as input and
output metadata. +
The value of this property must be the path to a JSON schema relative to
the location of the connector descriptor file. +
 +
In this case, the JSON schema appears as follows:

[source,json]
----
{
 "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
 "$ref": "#/definitions/PaymentInstrument",
 "definitions": {
   "PaymentInstrument": {
   "type": "object",
   "properties": {
     "name": {"type": "string"}
   },
   "required": [
     "name"
   ]
 }}
}
----

== Override an Operation Input or Output Type

You can also use the inputType and outputType properties to override the
type that is defined in the API spec. If a type is defined in the
connector descriptor, the one in the API spec is ignored.

== Skip Output Type Validations

`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `OPTIONS` operations defined in the API spec must declare a response body and a type for that body. If they do not, the connector descriptor must skip this check, define a response body for the operation, or declare it as void. +
+
Though is not the recommended approach, you can skip the this check using the `skipOutputTypeValidation` property in the connector descriptor.

It can be used at the operation level or globally.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connector Descriptor 1.0
apiSpec:
  url: './api.raml'
connectorName: Version Manager
skipOutputTypeValidation: true           #<-- Global
endpoints:
  /endpoints/users:
    operations:
      get:
        skipOutputTypeValidation: true   #<-- Operation Level
----

If the validation is skipped, the generated connector still generates an `InputStream` output for the operation, and it contains the actual server response, but without informing the user that this operation has an output. This is not recommended and should be avoided as much as possible.

If the operation does not have an output, the `voidOperation` property should be used instead of this.

== Void Operations

`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `OPTIONS` operations defined in the API spec must declare a response body and a type for that body. If they don't, the connector descriptor must skip this check, define a response body for the operation, or declare it as void.

You can declare the operation as void using the `voidOperation` property of the operation node in the connector descriptor:

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connector Descriptor 1.0
apiSpec:
 url: './api.raml'
connectorName: Version Manager
endpoints:
 /endpoints/void:
   operations:
     get:
       voidOperation: true   #<-- Operation Level
----

Using this property causes the operation to not have an `InputStream` as output. Instead, it always returns an empty string output. Using this property also causes the actual server response to be discarded. The HTTP response properties are still returned as attributes.
