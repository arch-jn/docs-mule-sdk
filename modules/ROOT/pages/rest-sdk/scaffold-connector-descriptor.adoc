= Scaffold a Connector Descriptor

To create a connector using REST SDK, you must first scaffold a connector
descriptor. Use a MOJO to scaffold a connector descriptor from an API specification.

== Connector Descriptor Overview

A connector descriptor is a YAML file that enables you to describe a
connector, customize aspects of the generated connector (such as name,
Maven GAV, operation names, layout information, and so on), and provide
additional metadata that is specific to Anypoint Platform Connectors.

When scaffolding a connector descriptor, do not edit the API
specification. The connector descriptor you scaffold has the same functionality
as your API specification.

If you must modify your API specification and a new version of an API specification
is released, move all the changes from the old version to the new version. API
specifications must be as complete as possible and provide rich schemas for every
input or output type, example, security information, and so on.

== Scaffold the Connector Descriptor

To scaffold the connector descriptor, run the `createDescriptor` MOJO:

----
mvn com.mulesoft.connectivity:rest-sdk-mojo:<PLUGIN_VERSION>:createDescriptor -DapiSpec=<PATH_TO_SPEC>/api.raml
----

The variables in the syntax represent the following:

* `<PLUGIN_VERSION>` is the version of the REST SDK plugin you want to
use. If you omit this parameter, the latest version is used.
* `<PATH_TO_SPEC>` is the path to the location of your API specification.

In the example MOJO command above, the *apiSpec* parameter is added using
the `-D` prefix since it is a required parameter. You can also add additional
parameters to the `createDescriptor` MOJO using the `-D` prefix:

----
mvn com.mulesoft.connectivity:rest-sdk-mojo:<PLUGIN_VERSION>:createDescriptor -DapiSpec=<PATH_TO_SPEC>/api.raml -DspecFormat=RAML -DoutputDir=./output/dir/ -DdescriptorMode=MINIMAL -DskipValidation=FALSE
----

The `createDescriptor` MOJO uses the following parameters:

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===
|*Parameter* |*Required* |*Description* |*Default Value*
|apiSpec |Yes |Relative path to the API specification for which to
create a connector descriptor. |-

|specFormat a| No |

Format of the API specification.

{sp} +

Allowed values are `RAML`, `JsonOAS`, `YamlOAS`, `JsonOAS3`, and `YamlOAS3`.

{sp} +

For API specification formats that are not supported, use https://www.apimatic.io/transformer/[API Transformer] by APIMatic to transform the format into `RAML` or `OAS` to use the tooling provided by REST SDK.
|If not specified, REST SDK autodetects the format based on the file extension and content.

|outputDir a| No |

Path in which the connector descriptor is placed.

{sp} +

The generated file is named `output.yaml` and is located in the specified
folder. |Current directory

|descriptorMode a| No |

Mode in which to generate the connector descriptor.

{sp} +

Allowed values are `MINIMAL` and `VERBOSE`. |`MINIMAL`

|skipValidation |No |Enables you to skip the validation step for an API
specification. Selecting `TRUE` might result in an invalid API specification or
issues generating the connector descriptor.

|`FALSE`
