= Scaffold a Connector Descriptor

To create a connector using REST SDK, you must first scaffold a connector
descriptor. Use a mojo to scaffold a connector descriptor from an API specification.

== Connector Descriptor

A connector descriptor is a YAML file that enables you to describe a
connector, customize aspects of the generated connector (such as name,
Maven GAV, operation names, layout information, and so on), and provide
additional metadata that is specific to MuleSoftâ€™s connectors.

When creating a connector descriptor, do not edit the API
specification. The connector descriptor you create has the same functionality
as your API specification. If you modify your API specification and a new
version of an API specification is released, move all the changes from the old version
to the new version. API specifications must be as complete as possible and provide
rich schemas for every input or output type, example, security information, and
so on.

== Scaffold the Connector Descriptor

To scaffold the connector descriptor, run the `createDescriptor` mojo:

----
mvn com.mulesoft.connectivity:rest-sdk-mojo:<PLUGIN_VERSION>:createDescriptor -DapiSpec=<PATH_TO_SPEC>/api.raml
----

* Where `<PATH_TO_SPEC>` is the path to the location of your API specification.
* Where `<PLUGIN_VERSION>` is the version of the REST SDK plugin you want to
use. If you omit this parameter, the latest version is used.

The `createDescriptor` mojo uses the following parameters:

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===
|*Parameter* |*Required* |*Description* |*Default Value*
|apiSpec |Yes |Relative path to the API specification for which to
create a connector descriptor. |-

|specFormat |No a|
Format of the API specification. +


Allowed values are `RAML`, `JsonOAS`, `YamlOAS`, `JsonOAS3`, and `YamlOAS3`. +


For API specification formats that are not supported, use https://www.apimatic.io/transformer/[API Transformer] by APIMatic to transform the format into `RAML` or `OAS` to use the tooling provided by REST SDK.
|If not specified, REST SDK autodetects the format based on the file extension and content.

|outputDir |No a|
Path in which the connector descriptor is placed. +


The generated file is named `output.yaml` and is located in the specified
folder. |Current directory

|descriptorMode |No |Mode in which to generate the connector descriptor. +



Allowed values are `MINIMAL` and `VERBOSE`. |`MINIMAL`

|skipValidation |No |Enables you to skip the validation step for an API
specification. Selecting `TRUE` might result in an invalid API specification or
issues generating the connector descriptor.

|`FALSE`
|===

== What's Next

Now that you've scaffolded a connector descriptor from an API specification,
proceed to xref:rest-sdk/create-connector.adoc[Create a Connector].
