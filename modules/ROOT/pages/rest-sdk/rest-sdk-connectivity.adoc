= Connector Descriptor

You can create a connector from an API specification, or _API spec_ (OAS or RAML), by using REST
SDK.

Creating a connector involves creating a connector descriptor that
articulates how the connector should look. You can then combine the
connector descriptor with an API spec and generate a connector.

You can use the following steps to create a connector:

[arabic]
. Scaffold the connector descriptor from the API Spec.
. Customize your connector descriptor to make the connector behave and
look as specified.
. Generate the connector using REST SDK.

== Using a Connector Descriptor

A _connector descriptor_ is a YAML file that allows you to describe a
connector, customize aspects of the generated connector (such as name,
Maven GAV, operation names, layout information, and so on), and provide
additional metadata that is specific to MuleSoftâ€™s connectors.

When you create a connector descriptor, you should not edit the API
spec. If you modify your API spec and a new version of an API spec is
released, you must move all changes from the old version to the new
version. API specs should be as complete as possible and provide rich
schemas for every input/output type, examples, security information, and
so on.

== Features in REST SDK

The following features are available in REST SDK:

* Instant connector generation from RAML 1.0, OAS 2.0, and OAS 3.0
* Maven distribution framework
* Support for paginated operations
* Triggers
* Value providers
* Sample data
* Security Scheme support for:
** Basic Authentication
** Digest Authentication
** Pass Through
** OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials
** OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code
** Bearer Authentication
* TLS support
* Filter out specific API operations
* Custom headers and query parameters at the global and
operation levels
* Global and operation-specific timeouts
* Support for reconnection
* HTTP proxy support
* Automatic error handling
* Support for multiple base URLs
* Ability to modify or extend the generated connector using Java SDK. You can:
** Add additional security schemes
** Customize operations
** Add message sources, expression functions, etc
** Add Dynamic DataSense
** Describe custom authentication

On the non-functional side, these connectors are fully

and also provide reduced and optimized _extension models_.


== Differences with Rest Connect

The main differences between the REST SDK and the Rest Connect v1 are:

* Unlike Rest Connect v1 which generates and deploys an unmodifiable
connector, REST SDK generates source code that you can version, modify,
and extend manually.
* REST SDK does not publish the generated connectors automatically. You
can deploy the connector at your convenience.
* The generated source code uses the Java SDK instead of the XML source
code.
