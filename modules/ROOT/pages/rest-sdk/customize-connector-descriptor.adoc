== Set a Description for the Connector

To set a description for the connector, you must set the
`connectorDescription` property, which is located at the root of the
connector descriptor.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

apiSpec:
 url: http://myhost.com/resources/shop-api.yaml

----

This description appears in the Connector POM file’s `<description>`
property.

== Set the Connector’s GAV

You can define a Maven GAV for the connector using the `connectorGav`
property, which is located at the root of the connector descriptor. You
must select a `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `version` which appear in the
generated connector POM and identify it as a Maven asset.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

apiSpec:
 url: http://myhost.com/resources/shop-api.yaml

connectorName: Shop Connector

 value: https://myhost.com/shop/api
 type: parameter
----

== Select a Category for the Connector

You can select a category for the connector using the
`connectorCategory` property, which is located at the root of the
connector descriptor.

The possible values for this property are `select`, `premium`, `community` and `certified`.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

apiSpec:
 url: http://myhost.com/resources/shop-api.yaml

connectorName: Shop Connector
connectorCategory: select

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: shop-connector
 version: 1.0.0

baseUri:
 value: https://myhost.com/shop/api
 type: parameter
----

This property indicates who is able to use this connector.

If the category is `select` or `premium` their respective license will be added.

== Set the Connector’s Namespace

You can select the XML prefix for the connector using the `extensionXml`
property, which is located at the root of the connector descriptor.

The value for the `extensionXml` property must be assigned to a valid
XML namespace.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

apiSpec:
 url: http://myhost.com/resources/shop-api.yaml

connectorName: Shop Connector
extensionXml: shop

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: shop-connector
 version: 1.0.0

baseUri:
 value: https://myhost.com/shop/api
 type: parameter
----

The value set for the `extensionXml` property defines how the XML for
using this connector in the Mule runtime has to look.

The following example shows use of a connector’s operation whose prefix
is `shop`:

[source,xml]
----
<shop:get-content-search
			doc:name="Get Content Search"
			doc:id="fa0f9783-c704-4ac2-bbf1-fee0f9987024"
			config-ref="Shop_Connector_Config_Client_Id"
			q="#[attributes.uriParams['query']]"
			count="1"
			initialOffset="#[attributes.uriParams['start']]"/>
----

== Select a Base Java Package

The generated connector is Java based, and you can use this property to
select the base package over which the rest of the project structure is
built.

You can set the base Java package by using the `baseJavaPackage`, which
is located at the root of the connector descriptor.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

apiSpec:
 url: http://myhost.com/resources/shop-api.yaml

connectorName: Shop Connector
baseJavaPackage: com.mulesoft.connectors

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: shop-connector
 version: 1.0.0

baseUri:
 value: https://myhost.com/shop/api
 type: parameter
----

The base Java package is used as the root package:

image::base-java-package.png[]

== Select a Base URI

You can select the XML prefix for the connector using the `baseUri`
property, which is located at the root of the connector descriptor.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

apiSpec:
 url: http://myhost.com/resources/shop-api.yaml

connectorName: Shop Connector

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: shop-connector
 version: 1.0.0

baseUri:
 value: https://myhost.com/shop/api
 type: parameter
----

There are 3 types of base URIs:

* Parameter
* Fixed
* Multiple

=== Parameter URI

The parameter base URI allows the developer to set a value by default,
and then the final user can change it. This is for cases where the API
can be hosted by the user, or there are different environments that the
final users want to access using this connector.

This base URI is used as the base URI for all operations.

The generated connector configuration appears as follows

image::shop-studio-config.png[]

The user gets the default value preloaded, and they can edit it.

=== Fixed URI

Fixed base URIs are similar to parameter URIs, although the user cannot
edit fixed URIs As such, all the operations in the generated connector
always access the same server. You can use fixed URIs when there is a
centralized server that has a fixed location, such as a connector for
GitHub.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

connectorName: Twitter Connector

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: twitter-connector
 version: 1.0.0

baseUri:
 value: https://api.twitter.com
 type: fixed
----

In this case, the `baseUri` field does not appear in the connector
configuration and the user cannot change it.

=== Multiple URI

Multiple base URIs work as a set of predefined fixed base URIs.

This is useful in the case where your API has to hit APIs located in
different places, such as an API that manages users, but also allows you
to upload files to a different server.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

connectorName: Complex API Connector

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: twitter-connector
 version: 1.0.0

baseUri:
   type: multiple
   mapping:
       uriUser:
           value: "https://users.com"
           default: true
       uriUpload:
           value: "https://upload.users.com"

endpoints:
   /api/users:
       baseUri: uriUser #Select the base uri for the endpoint (This is optional as it is the default base URI)
   /api/upload:
       baseUri: uriUpload #Select the base uri for the endpoint
----

In this case, all operations defined under `/api/users` access the
https://users.com/api/users[https://users.com/api/users] endpoint, and
the ones defined under `/api/upload` access
https://users.com/api/upload[https://upload.users.com/api/upload].

=== TLS Support

TLS support is automatically generated and does not need to be specified in the connector descriptor.
The only requirement for TLS support to be generated in the connector Configuration is that the API spec must declare support for the HTTPS protocol.
