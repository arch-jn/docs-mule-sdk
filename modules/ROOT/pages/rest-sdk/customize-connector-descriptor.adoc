ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::../_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

Customize the initial content of the connector descriptor of the connector.

== Set a Display Name for the Connector

To set a name for the connector, you must use  the `connectorName`
property, which is located at the root of the connector descriptor.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0
apiSpec:
 url: http://myhost.com/resources/shop-api.yaml

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: shop-connector
 version: 1.0.0

baseUri:
 value: https://myhost.com/shop/api
 type: parameter
----

The name you set for the connector appears in the Mule Palette in Anypoint
Studio and when you xref:exchange::to-publish-assets-maven.adoc[publish the connector to Anypoint Exchange].

== Set a Description for the Connector

To set a description for the connector, you must use  the
`connectorDescription` property, which is located at the root of the
connector descriptor.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

apiSpec:
 url: http://myhost.com/resources/shop-api.yaml

connectorName: Shop Connector
connectorDescription: This is the connector for the Shop API located in https://myhost.com/shop/api

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: shop-connector
 version: 1.0.0

baseUri:
 value: https://myhost.com/shop/api
 type: parameter
----

The description you set for the connector appears in the `<description>`
property of the connector POM file.

== Define a Maven GAV for the Connector

To define a Maven GAV for the connector, you must use  the `connectorGav`
property, which is located at the root of the connector descriptor.

You must select a `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `version`, which appears in the
connector POM file, and identify it as a Maven asset.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

apiSpec:
 url: http://myhost.com/resources/shop-api.yaml

connectorName: Shop Connector

connectorGav:

 artifactId: shop-connector
 version: 1.0.0

baseUri:
 value: https://myhost.com/shop/api
 type: parameter
----

== Select a Category for the Connector

To select a category for the connector, you must use the
`connectorCategory` property, which is located at the root of the
connector descriptor.

The `connectorCategory` property indicates who is able to use this connector. The
possible values for the `connectorCategory` property are `select`, `premium`,
`community`, and `certified`. If the category is `select` or `premium`, the
respective license is added.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

 artifactId: shop-connector
 version: 1.0.0

baseUri:
 value: https://myhost.com/shop/api
 type: parameter
----

== Set a Namespace for the Connector

To set a namespace for the connector, you must use the `extensionXml` property,
which is located at the root of the connector descriptor.

You can select the XML prefix for the connector using the `extensionXml`
property. The value set for the `extensionXml` property must be assigned to a valid
XML namespace.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

apiSpec:
 url: http://myhost.com/resources/shop-api.yaml

connectorName: Shop Connector
extensionXml: shop

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: shop-connector
 version: 1.0.0

baseUri:
 value: https://myhost.com/shop/api
 type: parameter
----

The value set for the `extensionXml` property defines how the XML looks when
using the connector in Mule runtime engine.

The following example shows the use of a connector's prefix, `shop`, in an
operation:

[source,xml]
----
<shop:get-content-search
			doc:name="Get Content Search"
			doc:id="fa0f9783-c704-4ac2-bbf1-fee0f9987024"
			config-ref="Shop_Connector_Config_Client_Id"
			q="#[attributes.uriParams['query']]"
			count="1"
			initialOffset="#[attributes.uriParams['start']]"/>
----

== Select a Base Java Package for the Connector

To select a base Java package for the connector, you must use the `baseJavaPackage`
property, which is located at the root of the connector descriptor.

The generated connector is Java based, and you can use the `baseJavaPackage` property to
select the base package over which the rest of the project structure is
built.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

apiSpec:
 url: http://myhost.com/resources/shop-api.yaml

connectorName: Shop Connector
baseJavaPackage: com.mulesoft.connectors

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: shop-connector
 version: 1.0.0

baseUri:
 value: https://myhost.com/shop/api
 type: parameter
----

The base Java package is used as the root package:

== Select a Base URI for the Connector

To select a base URI for the connector, you must use the `baseUri`
property, which is located at the root of the connector descriptor.

You can select the XML prefix for the connector using the `baseUri`
property.

There are three types of base URIs:

* <<parameter, Parameter Base URI>>
* <<fixed, Fixed Base URI>>
* <<multiple, Multiple Base URI>>

[[parameter]]
=== Parameter Base URI

The parameter base URI enables the developer to set a value by default,
and then also enables the user to change the value.

Use the parameter base URI when the user can host the API, or when there are
different environments that the user accesses while using the connector.

The parameter base URI is used as the base URI for all operations.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

apiSpec:
 url: http://myhost.com/resources/shop-api.yaml

connectorName: Shop Connector

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: shop-connector
 version: 1.0.0

baseUri:
 value: https://myhost.com/shop/api
 type: parameter
----

The following image shows how the generated connector configuration appears:

image::shop-studio-config.png[]

The user sees the default value preloaded, but the user can also edit the value.

=== Fixed Base URI

The fixed base URI is similar to the parameter base URI, however the user cannot
change the value of a fixed base URI.

Use the fixed base URI when there is a centralized server that has a fixed
location, such as a connector for GitHub.

The fixed base URI is used as the base URI for all operations to always
access the same server.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

connectorName: Twitter Connector

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: twitter-connector
 version: 1.0.0

baseUri:
 value: https://api.twitter.com
 type: fixed
----

In this case, the `baseUri` field does not appear in the connector
configuration and the user cannot change it.

=== Multiple Base URI

The multiple base URI works as a set of predefined fixed base URIs.

Use the multiple base URI when your API works with APIs located in different
places, such as an API that manages users.

The multiple base URI is used as the base URI for operations to
access different servers.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connect Connector Descriptor 1.0

connectorName: Complex API Connector

connectorGav:
 groupId: com.mulesoft.connectors
 artifactId: twitter-connector
 version: 1.0.0

baseUri:
   type: multiple
   mapping:
       uriUser:
           value: "https://users.com"
           default: true
       uriUpload:
           value: "https://upload.users.com"

endpoints:
   /api/users:
       baseUri: uriUser #Select the base uri for the endpoint (This is optional as it is the default base URI)
   /api/upload:
       baseUri: uriUpload #Select the base uri for the endpoint
----

In this case, all operations defined under `/api/users` access the
https://users.com/api/users[+https://users.com/api/users+] endpoint, and
all operations defined under `/api/upload` access the
https://users.com/api/upload[+https://upload.users.com/api/upload+] endpoint.

== Define TLS Support for the Connector

TLS support is automatically generated and does not need to be specified in the
connector descriptor. For TLS support to be generated in the connector
configuration, the API specification must declare support for the
HTTPS protocol.
