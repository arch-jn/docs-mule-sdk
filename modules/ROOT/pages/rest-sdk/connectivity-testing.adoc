= Customize the Connector's Connectivity Testing
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

The test connection method allows the connector user to check whether a connection against a server is valid in design time. By default, the generated connectors and their connection providers do not include a generated test connection method.

REST SDK allows defining test connection methods to the generated connection providers via a property in the connector descriptor.

== Add a Test Connection Method

Test connection can be defined globally for all of the generated connections or for a specific connection provider.

[source,yaml]
----
testConnection:
  path: my/path
  validStatusCodes:
     - 200
  responseValidation:
     validation:
        language: dw
        expression: "#[payload contains('string')]"

security:
  basic:
   testConnection:
     path: test/passtwo/fail
     method: post
     mediaType: application/json
     validStatusCodes: 210
     responseValidation:
       - validation:
           expression: "#[payload.userId != null]"
       - validation:
           expression: "#[payload.userId == 'lucas.giordano']"
         errorTemplate:
           expression: "#['userId (' ++ payload.userId ++ ') is expected to be lucas.giordano']"
----

This example shows both a global definition and one that is specific for a connection provider.

In cases where both test connections are defined, the one defined for the security scheme takes precedence.

In the testConnection property, you can define multiple settings for this test connection method that you are generating.

|===
|Property Name |Description |Default Value
a|
path

(Mandatory)

|This property allows defining the path where the connection validation
request is made. +
This can, for example, be a /health endpoint of the server API. +
If you are adding it to a security scheme, this path should point to a secured endpoint, as this allows the user to validate that the credentials that they are using in the connector configuration are valid. |-

|validStatusCodes |This property accepts a list of status codes that are
considered as a valid server response status code. The server response
for the connection validation request is validated against this list,
and if it is not included, the connection is considered invalid, and the
connector shows an error message specifying this. |200

|mediaType a|
The media type of the server response body.

REST SDK tries to get it from the content-type header, use this property if the response does not have a content-type header or if you want to override it.

|-

|method |Defines the method to use when making the request to the testConnectionPath. |GET

|responseValidation |This property expects a list of TestConnectionResponseValidation**.** |-

|TestConnectionResponseValidation |Is composed of a validation and an errorTemplate. |-

|validation +
(Mandatory if responseValidation is defined) a|
An expression used to validate the HTTP test connection request's response.

This expression must return true if the response is valid or false if it is not.

REST SDK assigns the body and attributes of the server response to the payload and attributes variables respectively.

|-

|errorTemplate a|
Allows defining a message to be shown to the user if the connection validation fails.

A default error telling that the validation expression failed appears if this expression is not defined.
