REST SDK provides metadata-driven features that create a unified connectivity
experience for all types of users:

* As an API developer, use REST SDK to produce connectivity at scale.
* As an integration specialist, use REST SDK to create connections when
your desired connector is not available in Studio.
* As an API product manager, use REST SDK to expand API outreach to developers
and non-developer users.
* As an API enthusiast, use REST SDK to develop and publish use-case based
connections for a growing marketplace.

== Features in REST SDK

REST SDK currently supports the following features:

* Instant connector generation from RAML 1.0, OAS 2.0, and OAS 3.0
* Maven distribution framework
* Paginated operations
* Triggers
* Value providers
* Sample data
* Security scheme support for:
** Basic authentication
** Bearer authentication
** Digest authentication
** Pass-through authentication
** OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant type
** OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant type
* TLS support
* Specific API operation filtering
* Custom headers and query parameters at the global and operation levels
* Global and operation-specific timeouts
* Support for reconnection
* HTTP proxy support
* Automatic error handling
* Support for multiple base URLs
* Ability to modify or extend the generated connector using Java SDK. You can:
** Add additional security schemes
** Add dynamic DataSense
** Add message sources or expression functions
** Customize operations
** Describe custom authentication

On the non-functional side, REST SDK connectors are fully
xref:mule-sdk/non-blocking-operations[non-blocking] and also provide reduced
and optimized extension models.

== Differences with Rest Connect

The main differences between REST SDK and Rest Connect v1 are:

* Unlike Rest Connect v1 which generates and deploys an unmodifiable
connector, REST SDK generates source code that you can version, modify,
and extend manually.
* REST SDK does not publish the generated connectors automatically. You
can deploy the connector at your convenience.
* REST SDK generated source code uses Java SDK instead of XML source
code.

== What's Next

Now that you've gotten an understanding of how REST SDK works and its provided
features, proceed to xref:rest-sdk/project-setup.adoc[Setup and Installation] to set up
